                Hacktoberfest is a month-long virtual event that encourages and supports open-source contributions. Sponsored by Digital Ocean and DEV, a contributor can qualify for the official Hacktoberfest swag by <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" class="text-orange-500 underline">registering</a> and making four pull requests between October 1-31

                Our goal is to provide support for contributors and maintainers. We want everyone to have an opportunity to contribute, regardless of their experience. Likewise, we want to provide maintainers with support to create projects that are contributor-friendly and will lead to repeat contributions beyond Hacktoberfest

                Because not everyone will need the same level or type of support, we're working to accommodate as many needs as possible. This could include 1:1 mentorship for one issue or all the issues you're working on, access to private slack channels, a group coding session, a review of the project you're using for Hacktoberfest, or general community support. We're also here to cheer you on throughout the month, whether on social media, through our events, or slack.
