                Virtual Coffee is a supportive community of developers at all stages of the journey. It started as a twice-weekly zoom chat about life and tech, but we've grown a lot in the last five months! We do a little bit of everything, which includes a thriving slack group, special events, mentoring sessions, and good people. If you're interested in joining, you can come to an event by signing up <a href="https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee" class="text-orange-500 underline">here</a>

                Hacktoberfest is a month-long virtual event that encourages and supports open-source contributions. Sponsored by Digital Ocean and DEV, a contributor can qualify for the official Hacktoberfest swag by <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" class="text-orange-500 underline">registering</a> and making four pull requests between October 1-31.

                Our goal is to provide support for contributors and maintainers. We want everyone to have an opportunity to contribute, regardless of their experience. Likewise, we want to provide maintainers with support to create projects that are contributor-friendly and will lead to repeat contributions beyond Hacktoberfest. Our goal is to make tech a friendly place for everyone.

                Because not everyone will need the same level or type of support, we're working to accommodate as many needs as possible. This could include 1:1 mentorship, access to private slack channels, a group coding session, a review of the project you're using for Hacktoberfest, or general community support. We're also here to cheer you on throughout the month, whether on social media, through our events, or slack.
